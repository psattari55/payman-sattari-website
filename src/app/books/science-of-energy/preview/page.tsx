              context="This foundational principle sets the stage for understanding consciousness as an integral part of reality, not something separate from or mysterious to it."

              text="When we see a woman sitting with her head in her hands at a park bench, it is not her physical appearance that concerns us. What is evident through empathy that is not visible to our physical eyes is this person's inner experience."
              source="The Nature of Reality, Chapter 1"
              context="This illustrates how reality includes both physical and experiential aspects, neither of which can be reduced to the other."

              source="Bias, Chapter 18"
              context="This distinction is crucial for understanding how subjective experience can be integrated into our scientific understanding of reality."
            />

            <Quote 
              text="If we consider the broader implications of this, metaphysics, in its true form, is a science of energy."

              context="This points to the ultimate synthesis: a comprehensive framework that unifies our understanding of both physical and conscious aspects of reality."
