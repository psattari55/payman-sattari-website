                    A groundbreaking framework for understanding reality at its

                    between physics and consciousness, this work reveals how
                    existence emerges through complementary forces: the
                    universal and the relative, the measurable and the

                    This first volume establishes the conceptual bedrock

                    faces of the same cosmic order.
