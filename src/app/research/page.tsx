              My research focuses on developing theoretical frameworks that bridge quantum mechanics, consciousness, and physical reality. This work spans multiple areas of theoretical physics and foundational studies, with particular emphasis on quantum measurement theory, the structure of space-time, and the quantum-classical transition.
