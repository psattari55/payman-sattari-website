When you take the "evil mask" off the face of fear, it is the face of a frightened child you find beneath.

---

There are a lot of frightening faces in the world. The face of fear shows itself in a variety of ways: the face of the schoolyard bully, the face of the dictator or despot, the face of the murderer or offender, the face even of the tormented. Collectively, they are the face of “the villain,” the one we have collectively blamed for all the bad in the world. The one we call “evil”. But what we don’t always realize is that these faces, the faces of fear in all its myriad forms, are really just a mask.

We are all born the same. We come in as innocent children–wide-eyed, in awe of the world, and in love with our parents. And the basic needs of this child—comfort, security, connection, love—are the same basic needs we have as adults. But as we grow older, our trust can get broken. Our basic belief in the goodness and integrity of the world and the people around us can be shaken by hurtful or traumatic experiences. The basic sense of security and safety we enjoy as small children can be rocked by these experiences, leading to fear and insecurity that we may mask in a variety of ways. We may develop layers and barriers to insulate that frightened child from the many dangers of the world. If the traumas are especially severe, deep, or prolonged, these masks can sometimes take on very frightening forms.

It is critical to understand that fear is at the root of this. Part of the spiritual path is learning how to see past appearances, to a deeper reality. The surface layer of things is always malleable and changeable. It doesn’t necessarily represent the truth. What is happening within is a better indicator. To mistake appearances for reality is like taking the image that people present to you as the absolute truth about them. The truth is, life is an “inside-out” movement. The surface layer of things is always a reflection of a deeper, inner reality.

When you understand that the child is always there, underneath that mask of fear or hatred, you also become less afraid. You are not fooled. While others around you may be focused on the violent, destructive or “evil” face without, you are conscious of the frightened, broken, and lost child within. This is the true nature of compassion where it comes to spiritual enlightenment. It means understanding the dynamics that are at play in human consciousness.

In the end, it means that we are able to turn inward to the monsters within *us*. It means to see past appearances, to look them in the eye, and take off their masks. It means that we are able to get in touch with the hurt child within *ourselves* and heal them. A healed inner child is a clear channel for light. An example of the unconditional love of childhood tempered by the mature adult who serves as their protector and guide in their journey through the material world. To be this child’s guide and deliver them from fear is a part of the journey to a peaceful and harmonious inner experience.
