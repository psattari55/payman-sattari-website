If you can't see what you're doing, *slow down*. Speed gives you focus, but stillness gives you visibility.

Imagine you are driving a vehicle. As it speeds up, the things on the periphery get blurrier and blurrier, while your objective, the destination where the vehicle is pointed, becomes clearer and clearer. The more you speed up, visibility of your aim, objective, or destination increases.

Now consider what happens when you slow down. As the vehicle approaches stillness, the images on the sides become clearer while visibility of your destination becomes unfocused, until the vehicle has come to a full stop and you have regained full visibility.

Speed gives you visibility of your objectives, where you are going. But it is when you slow down that you can really see what's going on around you, where you are. If you can't see what is happening, you are probably moving too fast. Breathe, cool down. Close your eyes. Refrain from doing, fixing, focusing for awhile. Return to your center, let the cells of your body breathe. *Slow down*, then once you feel calm, look again.
